# You are responsible for monitoring a web property for changes, the first
# proof of concept is a simple page monitor.  The requirements are:
# 1) Log to a file the changed/unchanged state of the URL
# http://www.oracle.com/index.html.
# 2) Retry a configurable number of times in case of connection oriented
# errors.
# 3) Handle URL content change or unavailability as a program error with a
# non-zero exit.
# 4) Any other design decisions are up to the implementer.  Bonus for
# solid design and extensibility.
